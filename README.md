#This project analyzes Airbnb listing data for New York City (2019) to uncover pricing trends, neighborhood insights, and property availability patterns. The dataset is cleaned, transformed, and stored in an SQLite database for efficient querying and analysis.

#Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, converts categorical data (e.g., room types to numeric), and removes unnecessary columns.

SQLite Integration: Stores processed data in a structured database for easy access and scalability.

Exploratory Analysis: Examines correlations between price, location, room type, and reviews.

#Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, SQLite3)

SQL (Database management)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn and PowerBI)

Goal: Provide insights for travelers, hosts, and real estate analysts on NYC Airbnb trends.
